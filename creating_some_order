The ORDER BY statement in SQL is used to sort the fetched data in either ascending or descending according to one or more columns. 

By default ORDER BY sorts the data in ascending order.
We can use the keyword DESC to sort the data in descending order and the keyword ASC to sort in ascending order.
synatax:SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column1 ASC|DESC , column2 ASC|DESC
  QUERY: SELECT * FROM Student ORDER BY ROLL_NO DESC;
          SELECT * FROM Student ORDER BY ROLL_NO ASC;
          SELECT * FROM Student ORDER BY Age ASC , ROLL_NO DESC;
